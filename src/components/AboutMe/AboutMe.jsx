        <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹,<br />
          So recently, I've been working as a Data Analyst in my past company which
          requires skills like data cleaning, data intergrity, data manipulation,
          calculations and problem solving by using python scripts and sql queries.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, I worked on Gsheet for Reporting, Analysis and calculations.</p>
        <p>
          So right now I'm trying to learn different skills to achieve better goals,
          and practice has made me better and better every time.</p>
